# AjaxExplorer
The Super Endpoint Explorer (SEE) app will allow the end user to craft requests to a remote end-point by filling out various form fields, send the request and show the response, and save common request configurations for later playback. The form of the tool is roughly like the Chrome Extension called Postman or an OSX HTTP exploration like Paw but obviously less polished and feature laden.
